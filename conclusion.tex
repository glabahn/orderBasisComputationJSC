The algorithms in this paper give fast procedures for efficiently
computing a large class of order basis problems, including those without
shift, those with a balanced shift or with a restricted unbalanced
shift. However a number of problems remain to be solved. In particular,
the efficient computation of order basis with a general unbalanced
shift remains an open problem. In addition, order bases are closely
related to many other problems in polynomial matrix computation, for
example nullspace basis and matrix normal forms. We are interested
in seeing how our tools can be used to solve these problems more efficiently.
Our work assumes that we are working with polynomials and power series
represented in standard bases. We would like to obtain efficient methods
for computation of order bases represented in arbitrary bases, particularly
those associated to interpolation bases. Finally, the constructions
used in this paper assume exact arithmetic where coefficient growth
is not an issue. We are interested in determining how our tools can
be used with methods such as fraction-free or modular construction
of order bases, particularly combining the constructions found in
\citep{BL2000}.
